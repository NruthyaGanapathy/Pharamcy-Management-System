The Pharmacy Management system is the system that stores pharmacy details. It is important for pharmacist to remember new batches of drugs, prescriptions and expired drugs and also the transactions related to purchases, sales and returns that are maintained manually and these are to be automated and an application is required so the current system can be replaced and accepted without any major changes or challenges.
The application should provide quick access to the records maintained and must expose the important reviews about the business growth and improvements so that the important decision could be easily taken. This system will have all the basic necessities to manage and operate a fully accomplished pharmacy.
The main objective of the management system is to automate the manually maintained records of medicines, sales, stocks, supplies, customer details and other related transactions. 
It allows the pharmacists to receive new batches of drugs, delete the expired drugs, store the physician prescription of the patient and also to modify and identify the dosage of drugs.
